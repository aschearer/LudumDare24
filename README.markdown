# How to Play

# How to Build

  1. Install Visual Studio 2010 or greater. (Note, I have not tested Visual Studio Express and suspect it will not work.)

  3. Restore referenes as needed. Typically the needed libraries are:
    A) In the project's folder under ThirdParty/Libs, or
    B) In the packages folder in the solution root
